Meditation timer app

I just want to replicate the meditation timers… the content is actually bullshit and would be easiest once you get the thing rolling.

    Free app with ad revenue would be best to start
    Content for free + in-app purchases would be great as later stage item

The real value is being able to create timers that have bells at either specific intervals or set times and making them easy to create.

    Hate the fact that you have to explicitly set the time of the bell determined as a fixed amount of time from the start or end… you can’t just add 3 mins from last bell which would make this much more intuitive
    Love the fact that you can create and save timers with individual names etc
        ***being able to publish and share these timers on social media would be awesome so that way you could drive additional adoption quickly***
        one yoga teacher with a youtube channel publishing a web version of this around a specific series or something - which drove users to download app – would drive adoption like crazy, man

The social platform is bullshit… would be way better to just connect to FB and/or InstaGram and youtube – again timers should be shareable once created in the app
Like the fact that you can play some background/ambient noise during timers (I can acquire this content no problem)

    Revenue oppty would be to drive in-app purchases for additional background noise
